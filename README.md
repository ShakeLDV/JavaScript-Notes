# JavaScript-Notes

Just a collection of JavaScript Notes.

Big note everytime you start going through these notes. The code always has to end in ; or it isn't going to run.


making a variable
```
var myName = "Leighiam";
```

to prompt a user to type something
```
prompt("What is your name?");
```
To store that inside a variable
```
var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");
```
Combining variables with string (I wish this had f strings)
```
alert("My name is" + myName + ", welcome to my github" + yourName + "!");
```
Printing to the console is not print() in JavaScript. It is as follows
```
console.log("Hello peeps");
```
## Strings
(I'm missing fstrings already)
```
"a" + "b" + "c"

"Hello" + " " + "World!"

var yourName = prompt("Input your name")

console.log("Hello there! " + yourName)

```
